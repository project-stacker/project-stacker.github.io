# Convert a Dockerfile to stacker yaml

When moving a project from a docker build environment to a stacker build environment, you can use the [`stacker convert`](../reference/stacker_cli.md#stacker-convert) command to create a stacker yaml file from the existing Dockerfile. 

!!! note 

    The conversion is a best-effort process and may not be successful in all cases.

During the conversion, variables from the Dockerfile may be exported to a substitution file, which can be declared in the `stacker build` command when building the project.  

When invoking the `stacker convert` command, you have the option to specify the input (Dockerfile) filename, an output (stacker) filename, and a name for a substitution file, if such a file is generated by the conversion.  Alternatively, you can use the default names provided:


| Command option | Abbreviation | Default name |
| --- | --- | --- |
| --docker-file | -i | "Dockerfile"  |
| --output-file  | -o | "stacker.yaml"  |
| --substitute-file | -s | "stacker-subs.yaml"  |


To execute a conversion, use the following syntax:

    stacker convert [-i <name>] [-o <name>] [-s <name>]
